A backup files. First git had COMMIT issues.
**About**
This project involved making an IoT Device that used 3 Tiers.

The first tier has the sensors and actuators connected to a Teensy.

The second tier uses a Raspberri Pi as a gateway.

The 3rd tier uses AWS as a broker for MQTT.

For my project I used a waterproof temperature sensor (ds18b20) and a 3-Axis accelerometer (adxl335), as the main IoT Device.

The second IoT device has a rotary encoder and 4 different coloured LED Devices
